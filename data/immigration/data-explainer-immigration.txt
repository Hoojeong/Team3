We used the below steps to extract data for the visualizations related to the immigration page.

Step 1: access pdf of aggregated World Values Survey results for China (http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSDocumentationWV7.jsp) and for the US http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSDocumentationWV7.jsp).

Step 2: transcribe relevant data into a csv file (immigration-input.csv), including copypasting each percentage of respondents in China and US under the categories of "Agree", "Disagree" and "Hard to Say" for Q122, O123, Q124, Q126, Q127, Q128 and Q129.

Step 3: convert to json using python (convert-immigration-data).
